# navbar
Hello and what's up guys welcome back.Today I will be showing an awesome navbar with dropdown made of pure css.
In this project I wanted to make it pretty simple for anyone to understand so I didn't involve any complex styling.
# So let's have a preview of the code....
<img src="https://github.com/cloutHacker/projectImages/blob/master/navbar/nav.png" alt="navbar" />

# With dropdown

So that's all for this repo I hope this provides a basic template for designing more elegant and complex navbar.

* I want to thank you all for being my followers and following up on my repos and I will be pleased if you continue on.👍
